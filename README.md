# Online Coach

Hi everyone! Novicegymadvice is a project I am working on to help coach beginners interested in getting fit. With my coaching services I will give advice from workout routine, form check, nutrition, and other information that a novice lifter would need. 

## About me

At the start of my journey I was 5â€™10 and 125 pounds and I could not even bench the bar. After many years of experimenting with different programs and adjustments to my form I am now able to bench nearly 300 pounds at 150 pounds. I am not an expert but I can give you advice that will optimize your training if you are looking for a natural way to get stronger.
