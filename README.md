# Online Fitness Coach

Hi everyone! Novicegymadvice is a project I am working on to help coach beginners interested in getting fit. With my coaching services I will give advice from workout routine, form check, nutrition, and other information that a novice lifter would need. 

## About me

At the start of my journey I was 5â€™10 and 125 pounds and I could not even bench 95 pounds. After many years of experimenting with different programs and adjustments to my form I have nearly tripled my benchpress, squat and deadlift. I am not an expert but I can give you advice that will optimize your training if you are looking for a natural way to get stronger. 

## What I can do for you...

* Give you my email and you can send me videos of your workout and I will critque your form
* Show you my own personal program
* Help create diets for weight gain or loss
* Teach proper gym etiquitte
* Customized Gym gear to help perfect your form

## Cost
